# Minesweeper
# Description
Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game where the player must uncover hidden mines on a grid while avoiding detonating them. The objective is to reveal all non-mine cells without triggering any mines.

# Features
Lives system: The player starts with a certain number of lives, typically three, and loses a life each time they detonate a mine.
Timer: The game tracks the time taken by the player to complete the grid.
Auto Solve: An optional feature that automatically solves the Minesweeper grid, revealing safe cells one by one until the game is completed.

# How to Play
Start the Game: Click on the "Start Game" button to begin playing. The grid will be generated with hidden mines.
Reveal Cells: Left-click on a cell to reveal its content. If it's a mine, a life is lost. If it's a safe cell, it reveals the number of adjacent mines.
Flag Mines: Right-click on a cell to flag it as a mine. This helps in keeping track of suspected mine locations.
Win or Lose: Continue revealing cells and flagging mines until all safe cells are revealed (win) or a mine is detonated (lose).
Auto Solve: Click on the "Auto Solve" button to let the game automatically reveal safe cells and complete the grid.
